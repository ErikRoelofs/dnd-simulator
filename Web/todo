Fix up actionComponent predictions. All should return a Prediction (which can be repacked by a higher level effect)

Pack tactics:
- on hit, apply an "adjacent" buff until start of next turn
- on attack, check allies for adjacent buff; if present and attacking the target, apply pack tactics

Armor class:
- allow conditions to modify armor tags (for wearing a shield)

Equipment:
- allow weapons to change how attacks work (proficiency, damage)
- give attacks sources
- allow armor to add new AC calculations
- allow selecting the right gear, and switching between equipment
- allow items to grant additional actions (potions)
- allow items to be spent/lost

Modularized actions:

- type component (when) (? or is this a cost ?)
- options component (riders, modifications)
- target component (at who)
- effect component (what)
- resource component (at what cost)

- follow ups?
 -> "swing action" -> "hit action" or "miss action" or "crit action"
 -> "swing action" -> "hit action" -> "maneauver action"
 - (for prediction, need to branch it)

- action execution plan:
-> analyse (receive a prediction tree (including follow-up options?))
-> choose
-> do the step
-> possibly trigger additional actions

======

- conditions
-V poisoned (disadvantage on attack rolls)
-V restrained (others have advantage on rolls)
-V paralysed (automatic crits, automatic fails)
-V incapicitated (actions available)
-- charmed (cannot attack the charmer)
-- petrified (resistance)
-- exhaustion (max hitpoints reduced; death)
-- concentration
=====

- buffs

- move statistics into classes? with calculations attached?
- give creatures a stat-container instead of methods?
- add modifications to change statistics
- should buffs also be "conditions"?

===
buff examples:

V increase ac
V (dis)advantage on saves
V (dis)advantage on attacks
- flat or rolled bonus to certain checks
- event-based (WHEN this THEN that)
- resistance/immunity/vulnerability
- modify Reactions
- apply conditions
- create temporary creature
- modify behavior
- change into something else
- change faction
- persistent magical effect

===========

Resource management:
V spells
V limited abilities

Goals:
V resource conservation
- predictions
- self-preservation
- encounter goals
- protect/buff friends
- debuff enemies

Battlefield:
- positioning
- area targeting
- death & dying

Actions:
- buffing
V advantage/disadvantage
V saves
V durations
- multipart (extra attack; condition bonuses like superiority)
- riders & modifications (casting from higher slot)
- conditions
- concentration
- temp HP
V resources as attachable to actions
- real attacks, with weapons

Interface:
- setup parties
- setup goals
- more readable logs

Core:
- events
- reactions (interrupts)
- expanded logging
- loading creatures from a library
- expand actions; make them modular


- multiple hits from a spell should use the same damage
